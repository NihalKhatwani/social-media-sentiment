Abandon Harris 24‚Äô is a swing state grassroots movement targeting voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.  Founded largely by people of Middle Eastern decent and since branching out to form a broad coalition of voters outraged by the Gcide in Palestine, they have drawn a Red Line with the Democratic Party for their support this election. Their demands have been simple Ceasefire Now or risk losing our votes and the election to Donald Trump.  For the last year this message has not been listened and as a result many people who would have voted Democrat will now leave it blank, vote for Jill Stein or Donald Trump.  To me this is a mask off moment for the Democratic Party, they chose selling weapons to Israel and a horrible war over womens reproductive freedoms, thats pure evil.  Democrats you have a real problem on your Left flank and I dont think you are going to be able to extinguish this movement easily.  Your best path forward is to listen to your Democratic voting base and  1. Ceasefire Now  2. Universal Healthcare 3. Ending Forever Wars 4. World Class Schools 5. Legalize Marijuana 6. Money out of politics 7. High Speed Rail Development Till then you are going to lose to celebrity game show hosts who played golf 1/3 days in office out of 4 years in office, over an entire years worth of days playing golf when should have working! Trump, a man who cares nothing about the issues he says to get in office. A weak candidate of the billionaire class offering no real solutions to meeting peoples material needs.
