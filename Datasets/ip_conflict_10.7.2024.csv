I have friends who are Zionists and they try to give me to go along with the carpet bombing of Gaza. And they say things like, Jimmy, I know that you support the LGBTQ community. You know who does it? Jimmy? Havas. Havas doesn't support gay people. What do you say to that? And I say, all right, I guess we should slaughter their children. They like about being non-throughfort in front of presidents, like modern rap twice, have been saying for 20 years, living together. But when it comes to Ukraine, I just think there's all the truth this time. It is amazing how they send $113 billion to Ukraine, just like that. Imagine if they wanted to send $10 billion to America, which would, by the way, pay for community colleges for the whole country. That would take a decade or two. That would require town halls, that would require hot baths, and it's too approved. I have to put on a t-shirt, interview, regular people on the street, $10 billion, that's a lot of money. Do you really want your tax dollars going towards college education? And $113 billion. Out the door, no discussion, without, to the most corrupt country in all of Europe, with no oversight at the blink of an eye, that's how you know it's about helping people. I mean, imagine what we could do with that money instead. Imagine we could do that money back to the United States. They say they can add homelessness for $20 billion. So for $100 billion, they can add in homelessness, then starting it again, then said, we were just kidding. And then fucking have it in again. Don't you think for $100 billion, they could have taken some of that money and bought a dog that would leave Joe Biden off stage when he's done business? It's weird. I notice every time we do go to war, it's never for what the American people think it is. And like for instance, Litzi Grant just announced a couple of months ago that there's $11 trillion worth of natural resources minerals underneath Ukraine. And then we find out there's $1 trillion worth of gas in oil and gas and it's off to shore. I'm starting to give you a little time and work admission here. And I wonder when the American people will wake up, hopefully people like Jose and Daya can help them wake up. But events like this and voices like yours will do that. I've had people on my show say, well you know having Israel as our ally in the Middle East is like having our own aircraft carrier in the Middle East.

This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging down across the iron.

Abandon Harris 24‚Äô is a swing state grassroots movement targeting voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.  Founded largely by people of Middle Eastern decent and since branching out to form a broad coalition of voters outraged by the Gcide in Palestine, they have drawn a Red Line with the Democratic Party for their support this election. Their demands have been simple Ceasefire Now or risk losing our votes and the election to Donald Trump.  For the last year this message has not been listened and as a result many people who would have voted Democrat will now leave it blank, vote for Jill Stein or Donald Trump.  To me this is a mask off moment for the Democratic Party, they chose selling weapons to Israel and a horrible war over womens reproductive freedoms, thats pure evil.  Democrats you have a real problem on your Left flank and I dont think you are going to be able to extinguish this movement easily.  Your best path forward is to listen to your Democratic voting base and  1. Ceasefire Now  2. Universal Healthcare 3. Ending Forever Wars 4. World Class Schools 5. Legalize Marijuana 6. Money out of politics 7. High Speed Rail Development Till then you are going to lose to celebrity game show hosts who played golf 1/3 days in office out of 4 years in office, over an entire years worth of days playing golf when should have working! Trump, a man who cares nothing about the issues he says to get in office. A weak candidate of the billionaire class offering no real solutions to meeting peoples material needs. He Failed to deliver on ‚Äúdraining the swamp‚Äù and reforming NAFTA better for workers.  Bought and sold candidate.  Yes Democrats you are at risk to losing to such a weak candidate again bc you are weak as well.

After 9-11, after the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, you saw in 2000 for a big shift in the voting block, all the way to Democrats to where I believe it is today in the 2020 election. Joe Biden received about 70 percent of Muslim or Arab American votes. Do you see that changing? Do you see a lot of people abandoning the Democratic Party and that community, voting third party, or switching to Trump? They already have.

And in so doing by power, to take the blame for her defeat on the night of November 5th. And then, result, the outcome, descend the signal to the political landscape that you should never have ignored us. When we sit ceasefire now, you sit ceasefire never.

Hamas is a terrorist, terrible terrorist organization that began this war with a horrific attack against Israel on October 7th. No one denies that. Sinwa who has just been killed is a war criminal. No one denies that. So the issue is not where the Israel has a right to defend itself. It does.

Israel has taken the same poison pill as the United States did after 9/11 and they are going to lose very badly the same way the U.S. failed in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Israel cannot win this war thru military force and we need political leaders that understand this. If elected to Congress I would introduce legislation to cut off all military aid to Israel and put economic sanctions on them until their government inplements a Permanent Ceasefire and takes concrete steps towards ending the military occupation of Palestine.  Here is footage from outside the Federal Building in Downtown Dayton on October 7th Peace Rally. Thank you to the 50 people who showed up and guest speakers who shared with us today.  #ceasefire #ceasefirenow #palestine #israel #lebanon #gaza #war #ww3 #protest #grassroots #independent #daytonohio #937 #dayton #wrightpattersonafb #trump #voteblue #maga #harriswaltz2024üíôüíôüíô #jillstein #greenparty "," You know, I think back to when I was in high school in one year anniversary of 9-11 and what would have the message been that day? We needed a peace message big time that day. Let me remind you, one year after 9-11, we were six months before invading Iraq. When you permit war based on lies or gorgeous reactionary war, I would say as Afghanistan was, with no end site, no end game, we're going to get the terrorists. Anybody who sides with them is also an enemy too. In this endless war, this is the same trap that the Israeli government is falling into right now. They have taken the same prison pill with the weapons and military industrial complex and the war propaganda in this country. And it's not going to end well for them and it's not going to end well for the entire world and the victims in the Middle East at all. We saw with the roar here this last year, the international community has not stepped up enough to stop and put enough pressure on the United States and Israel's stuff. Now they are exporting their genocide to Lebanon. Maybe to Syria, maybe to Iraq, maybe to Yemen. If we don't stand up and tell our politicians enough is enough, they will never stop. My personal message for this upcoming election is that genocide needs to be the red line and that whoever is in power, if it was a Republican, if it's a Democrat, the lesson needs to be learned. I'm going forward that if you're in power and you committed genocide or you bring us in a war based on lies like George Bush, then you lose. You lose. And I know the other side, as we saw the Democrats support the Iraq War and George Bush. And now we see the Republican supporting the Democrats with this. I know the other side would do it, but at least the lesson can be learned that you will lose and there will be power for the moderate and the peace voices in your party to change. I mean, gosh, what are we going to do? We've been voting for these people for 20 years and enough is enough. And I feel that genocide is a red line in texting with them. And I just wanted to read a text that we got this morning from one of the girls. She's actually a teacher there. And she and her family have gathered all the orphans now into the school. And they're actually actively still teaching there amongst all the rubble. Their parents are her father and her brothers are producing food to feed the people around them. So just for them to survive. So I really want to go ahead and reach you the her text from this morning because I think it's very important. So her name is her name is that the other and she says we are fine. Thank God for now, but I don't think we'll be alive soon. Mind you, this is today at 10 23 in the morning. The military operation in northern Gaza has begun. The bombing is everywhere in all its forms nonstop war artillery and naval. We are surrounded and cannot leave, but suddenly they entered with fire belt and surrounded us from all sides. I wanted to tell you this is her talking to her friend now. You are a spiritual mother to me, my support in my times of weakness. You gave me security in my times of fear. You are something beautiful in my life. I love you so much. If I don't make it, God bless you. I'm so proud of you that I met an angel with a beautiful heart like you. It seems that if we do not go to the south, we will die here. I choose to die here with dignity. I do not want to go to the south where humiliation and killing are easy. The angels are surrounding us. She said yes, thank God. Since yesterday the bombing has not stopped and the internet and transmission of everything have been cut off. I hate the night. It's never ending. Terrifying with constant bombing. The children are crying. They don't know if they will make it. I want to do more to protect my family. My brothers have dreams that I don't want to die before they see the light. How much I want the whole world to move together for us for the innocent people of Gaza. I think the enemy has had enough of killing. He has turned to Gaza and turned its rivers into blood that never stopped. Isn't that enough? It's time to stop the war. I left there just about a month ago today. It's a terrible situation. The takeover of the West Bank has been accelerated greatly. People are being forced out of their homes, forced out of villages they live in for hundreds of years. It is just a terrible situation. I don't know how else to say it. We did have a prayer service and interfaith prayer service at the border of Gaza. I was with Christians, Muslims, Jews, rabbis, Hindu, Buddhist activists, about 30 of us. There's an article that I wrote in the paper yesterday, taking daily news yesterday if you'd like to read that. It tells a little bit more. The two positives that I can give are the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the fact that it's a minority certainly. But within his really society there are grave Israeli Jews who are standing in solidarity in these little villages spending the night speaking Hebrew to some of the attackers who come at night at harass and sometimes kill these folks. So I just want to have that one hopeful note. Thank you. We need to do a moment of silence for all the victims that have been vanishing since then, since October 7th and before October 7th. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At least the one message that I wanted to read that I received this morning was so that influenced me so much because it has to do with children of Gaza that have been disappeared. This is a million, as you know, 50% of Gaza, the 2.2 million, are younger than 16 years old. So they are half of the population are too many. But this person, a young boy, perhaps 12 years old, read an English from a hundredth and yellow paper, this boy is full of defiance. We want to live. We want peace. We want to judge the killers of children. We want medicine, food and education. We want to live as the other children live. To keep that in mind, the children of Palestine are not collateral damage to the Germany of the apartheid state. And we are influencing that. We can stop that war by stopping army, the genocide state. You're probably an indicted by messages from either side with collages of their victims and their prisoners for almost a year now. What are we doing about it? How many more children, how many more babies, how many more victims we're going to add to this collage and keep publishing it on Facebook or whatever news media you like to listen to. The question is what are we doing about it? Just standing here at the event yesterday was a very symbolic one. We know we cannot do anything. But if we stop talking about it, nobody is going to listen. If you want to listen to something very influential, father David, he's a Catholic priest and he just put a TikTok video just last week about gaslighting. He was actually talking about the vice president debate. But if you listen to that video, it's exactly what our administration and you and I are being gaslighted about what's going on in Gaza, Palestine and now in Lebanon. Don't listen to the news. Make your own judgment about the victims that are being killed. One more time we cannot be equilateral damage as they call us because one person is hiding in the neighborhood. Collateral damage can go back to every hundreds of thousands of victims that died from one thousand others. Is that what we record humanity? The human beings that were lost? The lateral damage shame on those people that come up with these praises and don't understand the value of the fellow human being. I just saw in the paper that the government was giving $3 billion for new business research. They're just and look at Dayton. It's a press community. But it's not good enough. Springfield. It's a community that's falling apart. But they don't do that. Money only goes to the military does the complex. We have to see that as our main target. Power to the people. Thank you. It's the rubble. And that's what we see happening. The Israelis are trying to put the palatites in peace so they'll never hear from the began. That's what genocide is all about. We need peace with justice. But we cannot have justice without the truth. And unfortunately the media that we have in this society, manufacturers, untrue, manufactures deceit that is passed from the Israeli government through our government to our public. And that's why many people coming by have content for us instead of support for us because they don't understand what's going on in the world. They don't understand history. They have that red. Find the truth. promote the truth. Seek the truth. And unless people support that cause together what we need for the election in this country is a tribunal for war crimes. It's been done before. It's been done before. If we had any moral righteousness in our society, this is what we would do because it's partly obvious that this country is genuinely complicitous and more crime crimes against humanity in genocide. We need to take seriously a promote to find things of international criminal court. It's so easy for the rest of the society because there are media as nor is it. We treat international law as something voluntary, incidental and unimportant. We are basically saying that the world will be ruled by crime, which is what's happening right now in Gaza and Lebanon. And while our administration weeks as the bomb's built by our press, we're going back over again and again. The billions are spent in our money and our economy for the purpose of death, destruction, injustice. And it needs to stop. So we need to embrace our brothers and sisters throughout the world. We're demonstrating today for this important cause and persist in trying to find a way forward to truth and justice and peace on that basis. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As Wari well said, would anybody else like to come up and say anything off their chest on this day? This piece message? Come on up. Come on up. Has been white duo. Hello, I'm Nadia Malarkey. I was raised in Beirut, Lebanon. Can you hear me? Yeah, right in the microphone. Right in the hand. Okay, and I just want to deal with the heart. Our hearts. And I think that the reason people are responding with such a sense of this is so shameful. Because I really feel in this white sound, woo, woo to many of you, but I truly believe the spirit of the age that we are living right now is yearning for unity. And it is the way our planet needs to go and the environment is letting us know that this unity is destroying this planet, which is a beautiful creation, including all of its creatures, which include human beings. So all I would like to say is that we need to vote our conscience so we can sleep at night, as Mike said. But in our communities, we need to forge bonds of unity with all and try to educate people as to what the truth is without creating barriers or hatred. It's a hard road because it takes patience. It takes perseverance and it takes commitment to the end goal. We might not see it, but please let us be a path to the end which hopefully this planet will be able to appreciate someday.",no longer populated,,2024-10-17T13:38:42.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSG5RTnlzPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d11dd58ec71d268249eaf064779f714b241b1f64/post-25508307-342560157-thumbnail,32,0,2,355,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT0RUTnlzPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--42f6182d518320529ba1c69f63a2eeac9cefb1d9/osIjtkOAh1fCAXsiGHQfVILYvNmCnAe5ILIygg,

This interview was conducted after a long day of running around the mountainside. We were shocked to find out that the area has been swarmed with donations from the region and from across the country. Everyday people really stepped up to help others when in need.  As a member of Congress I vow to introduce legislation to bailout all homeowners whose homes were lost during the flood.  We need to be sending billions to Western North Carolina/East Tennessee rather than to Ukraine and Israel!! We discuss how towns are changed forever, the important work her group does with Veterans in this region, the worry and hardship that school districts have with locating unnaccounted for students, and overall lacking federal response.

The SESC, the River Flods and Pennsylvania was the worst flooding we'd ever seen. This is like a combination of both of those temples. And it's been really difficult. Because this is also so close to my home. Our organizations takes veterans into these mountains for hikes, for mental wellness and wellbeing. We teach kids about the environment. And now I feel like I have to switch gears and start teaching kids about natural disasters. How to be prepared, how to keep themselves safe. I think the delay in federal response created a vacuum that the community just immediately filled with some sort of things. And support and supplies and everything that people need, even rescue and recovery efforts. Discussed with people and like tell people how these communities and houses are cut off and how literally the river, how the river is in new places. The river is in new places. So where the road used to run along the river, the river took out the road entirely and is now there where the road was. So it's not just a matter of establishing asphalt. It's a matter of having to build a bridge over a new river for miles. If you wanted the road to go back in the same place, the other issue that we're having is the riverbed is now anywhere between 25 and 40 feet deeper than it was. So instead of being like a nice plain that like farm valley with a creek running through it, it is a, it looks like a valley with a huge cavern, 40 foot deep cavern running through it. So where these roads were, there's no more ground underneath that to just lay asphalt on. It's catastrophic. People are forced with either walking up the side of a mountain and then down and out. And so extremely rigorous. Her and her team is considering and plan in the planning stages of, you know, they're going to have to start backpacking in, you know, maybe actually blade trailblazing. And you know, we're getting helicopters, you know, dropping it. And to get you guys like some idea of the catastrophe, it's very hard to see because you, as you saw coming in, the difference between Swan and O. Black Mountain old four. And then driving up through Morganton and kind of around that eastern side and just Bruce Pine, it didn't, you didn't see a lot of damage. What you don't see are all the little haulers that got destroyed and all the little communities that got destroyed right along the river, right along the creek. Landslides took out entire like, you know, gatherings of homes. The lady here was actually just telling me that they still have 163 kids in the school system that are unaccounted for. And this area looks like it's really well supported, really well off. We're hearing this. They have gasoline. They have a national guard. But we still have a lot of people missing. And this is what I'm talking about, you know, the disaster relief. You know, we're sending money to the rich and the powerful and overseas when where is the well put in place plan to deal with disasters. Hurricane Katrina happened 20 years ago. This devastating, you know, flood happened. I mean, hurricanes come inland. Flooding happens. I don't want to hear the excuses about this.

By examining successful models from Israel and Saudi Arabia, we explore innovative ways to harness ocean water and ensure a sustainable future for arid regions around the world. #Desalination #WaterCrisis #SustainableSolutions #FreshWater #InnovativeTechnology #Israel #SaudiArabia #WaterManagement #EnvironmentalImpact #UrbanFuture"," Because if we can always afford to kill people, I think that we should be afford to heal people. And then furthermore, if we understand that fracking is going to create an opportunity to extract rare minerals, but it can also taint the water supply, why are we not investing more in desalination? Because every submarine and every aircraft carrier runs on uranium, it runs on nuclear energy, and it also runs on desalinated water. So you have a city of 6,000 people that can go under water for months at a time, and they recycle their air, they make fresh water out of the sea that surrounds them, and they run on uranium. And so we're not going to stop building more cities in the desert. You know, water is not going to become something that we're going to have to be more careful with. What we need to do is we need to create more water. And it just so happens that about 75% of planet earth is covered in water, and we have the technology to funnel fresh water inland, but we're ranked 33rd in the world for our ability to desalinate water. Right.

There is zero excuse for this immorality.  And this is why we cant have nice things in this country also because we ship it all to the Weapons Manufacturers and corrupt governments over seas.  I believe in a Government investing in its own people. Republicans say SOL with that and Democrats pretend to want to invest in us but let us down time and time again.  Hurricane Katrina was 20 years ago and both political partys have chose to fund the War Machine and the rich and powerful rather then the working class of this country.  They will give you gun rights amd abortion and then let the rest of our world crumble around us and i am sick of it. Im done with these two lying political partys and i hope you are too!!  #hurricanehelene #northcarolina #fema #disaster #disasterrelief #congress #politicians #crime #mutualaid #daytonohio #ohio #937 ," What's up everybody? I want to give an update on the date no high out to North Carolina, Hurricane Helene disaster relief fundraiser that my campaign along with a couple of other local businesses and good Samaritans have done. We have gathered a ton of stuff and I'm going to go ahead and give you a tour here inside the bus and show you everything that we've got and go over the whole long list. But first I'd like to say a couple of things. Right now the federal government in FEMA's disaster response is trash. The richest country on earth we're given money away to Ukraine we're given money away to Israel and there's a lot of our citizens that need it more. It is crime what our federal government has not provided enough resources for its citizens. So it's my hope to show action that we're going to do something about it. So right here got a huge long list. I must say the amount of supplies that we've gotten has been immense. We received roughly about $600 in personal donations and we spent virtually all of that. We're going to hang a little bit back for gas and I have a whole bunch of gas canisters in here that I'm about to fill up and we're going to use it for that. We bought hundreds and hundreds of baby bottles, baby formula diapers, all sorts of stuff. So let's just go over the list right here what we got. We got tons and tons of boxes of food and stuff. Thank you very much. We got 13 boxes of diapers about six or seven boxes of baby wipes. We've got tons of trash bags, zip locks, whole boxes full of bathroom, toothpaste, feminine supplies, small boxes with batteries and solar lanterns. We got cat and dog food. We got a gas grill and a charcoal grill. We got tons of bug spray, a whole box of kitchen pots, boxes of plastic containers and utensils, a camping chair, four huge packs of paper towels. We got seven 20-pound propane tanks and I must say I got that from South Park Tavern. Thank you Dana and thank you right now down there at South Park Tavern. They were also one of the local businesses that were in conjunction and their supplies are in here. So thank you on that. We got 18 large packs of bottle water and we got eight five gallon jugs with two spouts. So come on in here. Let's take a look. Also what we got in here. Got it all packed up last night. Up super late. I'm going to go ahead and I'll jump in here first. We got packed to the brim. All right. We got a huge 14 gallon gas tank here. I got six five gallon other gas tanks but as you can see we thanked to my dad. Came over last night with some packing boxes. We've got it all packed up. I'm actually surprised if it in here so well I can't believe it. But we've got it all in here. All evenly distributed tons of gas tanks. Got my generator in here. Got a whole box of bananas because they don't have an access to fresh fruit and stuff down there. What we're going to serve is we're going to serve breakfast pancakes with some syrup and we're also going to be serving hot coffee. We've got a panini maker. We're going to do grilled cheeses with cheese and turkey on it. Is there anything I missed on that? I would just mention Nikki. We can be cool. And yeah and then thanks to Nikki. Nikki's bringing down a whole bunch of stuff to Nikki. I billy gold bubble tea lounge. She has an entire horse trailer filled up and she's been also posting about it. So us are two you know campaigns to get all this disaster relief has been amazing. Shout out to my dad. Him and his wife went and spent $700 out of their own pocket. Their own money. Got a ton of stuff for this. So this is going to come together without all of you. I'll step out here. I'm going to be leaving. We're going to be leaving here at one around 12 30 or one o'clock from downtown and I should get in tonight. Gonna drop off supplies all day Tuesday and serve food all day Tuesday. I'm going to stick around till Wednesday. If we it says if we still have supplies. People have asked about my safety. The van. It's checked out. It's good. I'm going to be bringing you know my pistol with me. So you know people don't have to worry about looting. You know you hear about crazy things. So I'm coming down. We're very prepared with a group of people staying on Airbnb connected to OWL outdoors. They've been amazing. So anyway thank you for the outpouring support from everybody in the community and stay in touch and I'll post some footage when I get down there dropping it off.

Jon and I attended local Dayton Arab American Forum Picnic and he shared with me his experience about traveling to Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.  ‚ÄúOnce you see it, you can never unsee it‚Äù he says. Another thing that stood out to me that i keep hearing from people over the last hear is people that are staunch defenders of Israel- when they visit the occupied West Bank their entire view is changed about what is really going on over there.  Jon tells of a woman who completely changed her mind on support for Israel after seeing the apartheid and racist and inhumane military occupation taking place.  Thank you Jon for being a messenger of Peace and thank you for sharing.  #maga #trump #israel #oct7 #neverforget #peace #congress #republican #daytonohio #937 #ohio #ceasefirenow #palestine #gaza #greenparty #democrat #kamalaharris2024üá∫üá∏üíô #voteblue "," And here today at the Dayton Arab American Cultural Picket, today with John Wagner. We were invited here as guests of the community and thank you very much for having us. John Wagner is a local, a Daytonian resident, I believe lives in Middletown, local regional resident. He recently did a trip to Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. And he is here to describe like why he was there and what he did up there. So take it away, John. All right. I first went over to Israel and Palestine in 2008 and was invited over by my denomination. I'm a United Methodist and we had mission staff over there who were imploring us to come over. They were all sorts of missionaries. I mean conservative, theologically liberal, whatever, but they united in saying there's something you really have to see. And so I went over there and I saw the occupation of close, met some of the people. Of course, you met Palestinian Christians, but Muslims as well, sympathetic Israelis. And once you see it, you can't unsee it. And so that's my, that's how I got to see it. How long were you over there for? That first time was about 10 days. And I've only been there three times. I was there in 2019 and then just last month. And what are some of the biggest takeaways you'd like people to know, like that live here, and see it yourself in the end? What I think is important for people to know is that America's support for this occupation of Palestine is just unjust. And I think if people saw what I had seen, they would feel the same way. On my first trip, I was there with what's called a Christian Zionist. Actually, a couple. They were both Christian Zionists. And that means that they have a belief system where Jews are supposed to come back and take over all of historic Palestine. And this will be a entry point for the return of the Messiah and the end times. So it's not a belief that I adhere to, but she came on the trip to kind of check out her information. And I would say within one week, she had totally reversed herself. She was meeting Palestinians, meeting real people, hearing the stories of a dreadful occupation, you know, where thousands of people are imprisoned, including children. People are killed with impunity. I must say this last trip was particularly distressing. There were so many instances of people being shot or imprisoned. It's just a horrifying thing. We were mostly in the West Bank and what has happened since there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in Gaza, which in my view is a genocide. There is this is an opportunity for the Israeli government to take huge swaths of land, 3000 plus acres just since October 7th. So in the last year, and this is, people understand, this is settlers, Jewish settlers coming in and by force taking Palestinian land off the time they've gone away. They're often aided by the Israeli defense forces and the settlers are a whole mixture of people. Some are really economic refugees from countries, Arab countries, whether Jews or European countries. And they are there for just a better way of life. And they're not really cognizant of what's going on. They think they're in Israel. And these what they call settlements are actually cities. And they're throughout the West Bank. Three quarters of a million right now. And they're basically taking over all this land that's supposedly set aside for a Palestinian state. They have their own roads. The Palestinians are not allowed to drive on. They're not allowed to go into the cities. And they are also putting slantways pipes into the aquifers so that they basically take all the water. And that area and politicians, and I think it's important for people to know when politicians talk about a two state solution. I recognize that many of them are sincere, but it's pretty much a move point at this point. It's not there's not going to be a Palestinian state with any kind of concept of a state we might realize. It's all just with cheese now. But any reno contiguous state. What kind of state? You know, absolutely. What kind of differences did you notice over there being in American versus the first of the Palestinians that were living in the West Bank? Well, we have immense privilege. And it's important for us to take advantage of it as as American citizens. We are from the country that is supplying tremendous amounts of military aid. And we have some influence over there. Although our governments have not been exercising it, I think the last person to really threaten the withdrawal of American aid of all people was George H. W. Bush. And he and Ronald Reagan did too some. But it is really just irreprehensible. We did go to the American Embassy and asked him this question directly. And I'm convinced that they really want to seize fire. They really do. Americans want to seize fire, at least the administration wants to seize fire, but they're not willing to leverage this military aid, which, of course, make that more life. Did you witness? Was there different rights for you as an American over there in the West Bank versus a, isn't it, there's roads that Israelis and Americans can walk on and Palestinians are not allowed to see them? Not so much walk on, drive on. Drive on. And there are places in Hebron, for example, which is a West Bank city that has sacred troops, Muslims and Christians and Jews, actually. It is there are parts of there where it's very difficult for Palestinians to be. I wouldn't say it is as overt as that where people are singled out. It wouldn't be like Nazi Germany with yellow stars. But there is extraordinary prejudices. And they are not allowed to see the power of Palestinians are issued different license plates. Over there, even in these, these are Israeli Palestinians. There are, there's an Israeli Palestinian minority within Israel proper and they are allowed to vote, but they're not allowed to bring their families over. They have to have special license plates, special IDs. It's really an apartheid system, you know, in any reasonable use of the word. All right, cool. I'm going to wrap this up. I would say a key takeaway though that you said that you traveled over there with a Christian Zionist and you said after being there for one week, she changed her mind. She changed her mind. She actually evolved by the agreement. She actually, on the wall, God hates this wall. And what I might view is that the Christian Zionism that is supporting a lot of the American support for Israel right now, the unfalify support in the words of a friend of mine, a Palestinian scholar, just says it's a mile wide in an inch deep. I think that if Americans could see it like I have, they would change their minds. In fact, I changed my mind on my first trip. I wasn't anti-Palestinian, but I was certainly much more for this kind of idea that both sides have their claim and so forth that really isn't that. So that's my story. Cool. Well, thank you, John. John has been an active member here in the dating community. He was speaking out at the Dayton City Commissioners back in November and December, getting the city of Dayton to speak out for a ceasefire. He's been active in anti-war movements in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam War. He's a man of faith and a man of action. And it's been a pleasure. I've gotten a chance to know him a lot this last year. I appreciate that, Michael. Thank you. And I certainly admire your stance. Michael has been to almost all of our demonstrations. We really appreciate that. Cool.
